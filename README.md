# Who-is-Reciting

<p>Ever wonder who do you or have the potential to recite like. This <strong>AI</strong> powered web app made using Teachable Machine might help you. Trained on recitation data of Sheikh Abdul Basit Abdul Samad, Mishary bin Rashid, Abu Bakr al-Shatri, Abdur-Rahman as-Sudais, Junaid Jamshed, and Omer Amin. It detects the similarities between your and the reciter's voice using CNNs. This App by no means accurate and is at a very early prototype stage. It should be noted that this App is far from perfect and implementation is not great. I failed to achieve to achieved what I wanted.</p>
  
## What I wanted and what I was able to do.
<p>At first, the plan was to train the model using the Tensorflow python api through Google Colab, and then implement the trained model and architecture on web though Tensorflow.js but I failed to achieve it due to my lack of experience in JavaScript, and tight schedule. At the end, I had to cheat and use Teachable Machine and ml5.js to create and train a model, but that solution is less flexible. I also think implementation and use of CNNs is questionable for this task, but again it caan be due to a small dataset. In the future, I will research newer ways to make this web app better. All this, it was still a joy to participate in my first hackathon, and I hope that the Ummahacks team continue to conduct such events in the future, Insha'Allah.</p>
